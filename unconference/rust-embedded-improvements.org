* Session Overview

Rust embedded supports a lot of platforms, but there is a lot of opportunity for more and better HALs, devices and services. How can we get more involvement, including by companies?

** Connection to Conference
- Builds on embedded discussions from main conference
- Company involvement like Rivian
- Safety-critical applications

* Current State of Embedded Rust

** Strengths
- Memory safety without GC
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Great type system for hardware
- Active community

** Gaps and Opportunities
- [ ] HAL standardization
- [ ] More vendor support
- [ ] Better debugging tools
- [ ] Documentation improvements
- [ ] Training materials

* Key Discussion Points

** HAL Ecosystem
1. *Current Fragmentation*
   - Different APIs per vendor
   - Inconsistent quality
   - Missing platforms

2. *Standardization Efforts*
   - embedded-hal traits
   - Common patterns
   - Testing strategies

** Company Involvement
- How to convince vendors?
- Business case for Rust
- Support models
- Training needs

* Action Items

** For Community
- [ ] Identify priority platforms
- [ ] Create HAL guidelines
- [ ] Improve onboarding docs
- [ ] Build example projects

** For Companies
- [ ] Contribute HAL implementations
- [ ] Sponsor development
- [ ] Share use cases
- [ ] Provide hardware

* Resources

** Key Projects
- embedded-hal
- probe-rs
- Embassy
- RTIC

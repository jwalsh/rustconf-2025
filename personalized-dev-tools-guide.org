   - Estimated savings: $30-40k/year
   - Implementation time: 1 week

2. **Strategic Move**: Adopt Burn for ML projects
   - Replace Python ML pipeline
   - 3-5x performance improvement

3. **Team Enablement**: Build developer tools
   - Custom cargo commands
   - Automated workflows
   - Shared configurations

4. **Long-term**: Type system mastery
   - Safer code architecture
   - Compile-time guarantees
   - Zero-cost abstractions
